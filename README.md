# UVM_ALU_Sequence

Create a UVM model consisting of a sequence, sequencer, and driver (Contained in some hierarchy of your choice). Generate 50 patterns to test the carry from bit 5 to bit 6 in an ALU. Generate 100 patterns to text bit XOR for all 36 bits.  Print the pattern data in the driver (There is no DUT for this problem).

Assume the ALU has 4 inputs

A 36 bits signed

B 21 bits signed

op 1 bit 0= add 1=xor

ci 1 bit (carry in)

Assume the ALU has 2 outputs

Z 36 bits signed

co 1 bit (carry out)
